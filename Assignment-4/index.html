1.) Mix minced beef, onions, garlic, coriander and parsley, tomato sauce, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl. Mix well by hand.

2.) Add rice and mix by hand. If you don't want to add in rice just skip this step!

3.) If using fresh grape leaves, cut the stems and blanch them in boiling water first. Canned leaves can simply washed in hot water.

4.) Add some grape leaves to the bottom of a medium to large pot to keep dolma from sticking.

5.) place a leaf upside down *stem towards you* on a plate or cutting board put a teaspoon of filling near the stem and roll up like a cigar.

6.) Place rolled dolma in the pot. You can layer two or three layers deep.

7.) Place a plate on top of the dolma and add two cups of water. You can add extra tomato sauce for a stronger flavor.

8.) Heat oven to 300 F and cook for 50 minuets.

9.) Add yogurt, garlic, mint, and salt and pepper to taste to create the yogurt sauce.

10.) Enjoy!
