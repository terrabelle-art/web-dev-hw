I took this class to meet my basic art requirements, but also to gain a better understanding of what goes into the creater side of the internet. I feel like there is a lot I could learn from this class, and I think I will enjoy it as well.
Honestly I am at total ground zero as far as web developement knowlage, but I mostly just want to have a better general understanding and have gained some useable skills.
I chose an image of my cat donald and his favorite cat nip carrot. animals in general are big part of my life, but I think this particular image just screams impending chaos... which is also a big part of my life.
