  <h2>Review of Fabled 2021</h2>
  <div id="to-change">
     <p>Fabled was a wonderful collection of short plays and dances, my personal favorites of the plays being On Your Mark and End Of The Line. I have actually seen the play about three times, while in my house management course, each time noticing something new! I really enjoyed the stage design and costuming, especially the use of one large stage prop throughout the plays. I also appreciate that the production was aimed towards children but still was entertaining and enjoyable for an all ages audience.
</p>
     <p>Firstly, I want to touch on how effective the storylines of these plays were conveyed with a very minimal stage design. The stack of books on stage looked perfect and rolled seamlessly to every mark. This was a whimsical prop that acted as not only a nod to the story book nature of the plays, but also an effective platform for the actors. I also really enjoyed the fork from End Of The Line. It was extremely realistic and I definitely could have seen it in a sculpture class!
</p>
<p> The Costuming for Fabled involved many quick changes and simplicity, however it fit perfectly! For example in On Your Mark the actors playing the hareâ€™s parents changed on three times throughout the play, and with the help of some intentional body language made it a seamless transition. Even when changing on stage! There were several plays that have animal or insect characters, these roles often simply put on a set of antennas or bunny ears and were completely transformed. Overall the costuming worked really well across the board, and the actors were able to bring these characters to life. </p>
<p> I think these storylines were perfect to keep an audience of kids engaged, as well as their parents. Many of the stories used recognizable characters or plot lines, but with a fun and modern twist. They brought up important topics such as rent, mortality, and insecurity. Disguised by cheerful songs and fun costumes, was some serious and relevant subject matter. The shortness of the plays also helped make them easily digestible, and perfect for kids ; as well as those of us with small attention spans. They included tons of small jokes and lines that really made the experience. Another little aspect that I really enjoyed was the intermission. When coming back from intermission they had a funny dialog of waiting for the show to start displayed on the screen, just as an extra feature for those who returned a tinge early. Little details like these elevated the experience for me and brought many laughs.
</p>
<p> In conclusion, Fabled was a wonderful collection of fun characters and scripts. These works appealed to a wide audience through clever references and catchy songs. The costume and set design, although minimal, was perfect for each play. The dances and quick run times also helped break up the acts and left the audience with multiple great takeaways. Overall the team put on a great performance on all fronts each time I saw it. I am excited to see what they come up with for next year!</p>
