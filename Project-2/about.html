  <h1> Why Ceramics? </h1>

  <body>

    <p> I choose to show a simple ceramic project for my instructable. Ceramics has been a theraputic practice for me the last year and has really given me an oppertunity to dig deep into my imagination. I also am a fine arts student and scuplture art is what really pushed me to make the switch over from business and marketing. I hope you enjoyed this project! </p>
