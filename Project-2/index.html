      <ul>
        <li>ready to use ceramic clay</li>
        <li>rolling pin</li>
        <li>thick cloth</li>
        <li>two identical thin wooden planks/ rulers</li>
        <li>sharp ceramic tools/fork</li>
      </ul>

      <h2> Directions</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Step 1 - Roll out a slab, to do this you will put a ball of clay in between the two rulers with a rolling pin. Make it as even as possible.

          <li>Step 2 -  Once the slab is rolled out, you will cut out a long strip of clay and a circle of clay. This circle will be the bottom of your mug and the long strip will be the walls.Now you can use slip and scoring to attach the pieces. To score you will take that sharp object or fork to creat scratches on the areas of clay being attached, you will then add water or slip (water and clay mixture) to secure the clay peices together.

              <li> Step 3 - You now cut a smaller stip of clay and then score and slip it to the walls of the mug to create a handle.

                  <li> Step 4 - Once you have all the componets of your mug, you can add extra clay or fun molding techniques to customize the mug to your liking!

                      <li> Step 5 - Glaze! use ceramic glazes (pigment mixed with granduales of sand and other components) to paint on colors and finish your mug before the final firing!  Ps. You can bisk your pottery and fire it once before glazing if you would like!
