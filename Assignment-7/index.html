    <p> Crumbl Cookies si know for very sleek and distictive marketing imagry and tactics. As far as imagry they stick to a strict color pallet of black, white, and baby pink. They usitlize high contrast and blocking colors in thier website design, social medial, and promotional materials. They also use repetitive marketing tactics to gain repeat customers, their most sucessful being a weekly cookie change. For example here are the cookies for this week! </p>

      <h2>  Cholcolate Mallow Cupcake </h2>

    <p>  These simple yet distinctive styles have created some contiversy with other brands. Recently resulting in Crumbl suing multiple cookie companies for copy right infringments. The other companies main arguements being that thier trademarks are too basic to be truley stolen, there is also back lash towards crumbl for going after smaller companies.</p>
